sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: The iterarions required in the worst-case scenario are those of the best-case scenario squared

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: The iterations requited in the worst-case scenario are similar to those of the best-case scenario and of the random-case scenario, and has a lower time of excecution than the sort2 algorithm (has a similar behaviors in their three scenarios)

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Has similar time of execution in their three scenarios, but not the best performance compared with the sort2 algorithm
